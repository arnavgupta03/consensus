# consensus

[Consensus](https://consensus-web.herokuapp.com) allows users to choose a movie to watch from a variety of options. Consensus allows each individual user to provide their input on which movies they would like or would not like to watch, based on the genres they like, and takes the input of the users until each person in a room has found at least one movie they would like to watch. Consensus then allows users to rank the movies, and weighs the rankings to provide users with the final movie choice.
